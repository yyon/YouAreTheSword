Then use ${normal} to swing it.

Your current sword transformation is displayed in the top-right.
Your sword will stay transformed even when it is passed between people.
Except the throwing animation won't change because we haven't programmed that in yet.

Still, you can transform your sword with one person and swing your sword with another person.
Try it out by using a knight to transform your sword into an axe, and use the mage to attack this combat dummy.
